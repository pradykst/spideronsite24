Plan
Set up WebSocket Server:

Use a WebSocket library (e.g., ws for Node.js) to create a WebSocket server.
Handle connections, disconnections, and message events.
Client-Side WebSocket Integration:

Implement WebSocket client in the messaging app to connect to the server.
Handle sending and receiving messages in real-time.
Group Chat Functionality:

Create APIs to manage group chats (create group, add/remove members, etc.).
Update WebSocket server to handle group messages.
End-to-End Encryption:

Use a library like crypto in Node.js for encryption/decryption.
Encrypt messages before sending and decrypt upon receiving.
